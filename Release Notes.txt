In this release 1.5.1 it was added support for useful stuff and some very nice resources.

---

**New Features:**

- Easy support for multi-tenancy (multiple database connections), using a static class DbConnections.

- Implemented a Helpers machine, with some useful stuff like cURL and Log. You can access the helpers calling Helpers::[helperName](), wich will return an instance of the helper class.

- Support for responses of type CSS

- Mechanics of Events and Listeners. You add event listeners in the same manner that you'd add a WebService and its endpoints and, besides the built-in events you can also define your own. (Very practical and useful ;D)

- Implemented a parameter "$limit_multiplier" into SQLParams, which is the class that process bindParams() function, to allow more arbitrary settings for pagination.

---

**Fixes:**

- WebServices were returning its execution before committing transactions.

- Minor namespace bug fixed on DBmetadata class.
